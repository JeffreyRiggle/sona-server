# Logging
Sona has a logging mechanism built in to help diagnose issues. Right now there are a couple configuration options to controll this.

## Enabled
You can enable or disable the logging from sona.

## Path
You can configure where the logs are stored.

```json
{
    "logging": {
        "enabled": true,
        "path": "/desired/log/path"
    }
}
```
